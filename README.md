![Sydney Skyline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Sydney_skyline_at_dusk_-_Dec_2008.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Sydney's real estate market**, performing **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis**, and building predictive models to estimate **home prices**. The final working prototype is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input features and get predicted property prices in real-time.

## 📊 Key Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing using **Pandas & NumPy**  
✅ Feature Engineering to enhance predictive power  
✅ Data Visualizations using **Tableau**  
✅ Regression Models: **Linear Regression & Lasso Regression**  
✅ Interactive Web App built with **Streamlit**  
✅ End-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline

## 🗂️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning
- Collected Sydney housing data (source: [Specify Source if available]).
- Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
- Standardized numerical columns for better modeling.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized price distributions, location-wise trends, and feature correlations using:
    - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for Python-based visualizations.
    - **Tableau Dashboards** for interactive insights (link to Tableau if available).

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created new features (e.g., price per square meter, proximity to amenities).
- Applied scaling and encoding for model compatibility.

### 4️⃣ Model Building
- Built and compared:
    - 🔹 **Linear Regression** - Baseline model.
    - 🔹 **Lasso Regression** - To reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- Evaluated performance using RMSE, MAE, and R².

### 5️⃣ Deployment via Streamlit
- Developed an interactive **Streamlit app** where users can:
    - Input property features (size, bedrooms, suburb, etc.)
    - Get an instant prediction of the property price.

## 🌐 Streamlit App Preview

The project includes a **Streamlit web app** that allows users to input property details (bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.) and receive predicted prices in real-time.

Here’s a preview of the app:
